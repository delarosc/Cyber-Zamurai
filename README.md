# Cyber-Zamurai
#The system's primary goal is to simplify academic scheduling by automating the allocation of teaching resources and centralizing course-related data. Administrators will manage a comprehensive database of faculty members and course offerings. For each semester, the system will facilitate the creation and modification of course sections, assigning 
qualified faculty based on availability and expertise.
